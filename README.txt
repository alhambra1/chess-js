* JavaScript Chess *

*                  *

* Works in Firefox browser. To start, unzip and open the "index" page.

* Configure board colors at the top of the index file.

* Configure "log stats" at the top of the "bin.js" file to output the static exchange stats to the console.

  (Keep "log stats" set to false on the "binCpu.js" file.)

* To alert a PGN log, open a JavaScript scratchpad (Shift+F4 in Firefox), type "pgn()" and run (Ctrl+R).

* "Chess-Stand-Alone" is simply the "index" and "bin.js" files combined and the images turned off. 

  (CPU engine is still separate, though)
