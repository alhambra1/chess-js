* Works in Chrome, Opera or Firefox 18 browser (need to investigate fix for newer Firefox version). 

* To start, unzip and open the "index" page.

* Configure board colors at the top of the index file.

* Configure "log stats" at the top of the "bin.js" file to output the static exchange stats to the console.

  (Keep "log stats" set to false on the "binCpu.js" file.)

* To alert a PGN log, open a JavaScript scratchpad (Shift+F4 in Firefox), type "pgn()" and run (Ctrl+R).
