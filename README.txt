* JavaScript Chess *

*                  *

* Works in Firefox, Chrome or Opera browsers. 

* To start, unzip and open the "index" page.

* Configure board colors at the top of the index file.

* Configure "log stats" at the top of the "bin.js" file to output the static exchange stats to the console.

  (Keep "log stats" set to false on the "binCpu.js" file.)

* To alert a PGN log, open a JavaScript scratchpad (Shift+F4 in Firefox), type "pgn()" and run (Ctrl+R).

Note -- a few times so far, jQuery and jQueryUI functions returned 
errors until I updated the src links to their newer versions. Since I am not regularly 
maintaining this code, you might want to experiment with that if you experience problems.
Thanks for visiting!
